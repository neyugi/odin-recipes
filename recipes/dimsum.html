    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Chinese New Year is celebrated with parades and lavish feasts meant to usher in a fortuitous year. Har gow are an ideal celebratory food for Lunar New Year celebrations for a couple of reasons. Dumplings—filled with everything from ground pork to vegetables—symbolize prosperity and wealth.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Shrimp</li>
            <li>
                Bamboo shoots (buy sliced bamboo shoots in a can, but be sure to drain them and soak them in water for several minutes before using them to rid them of the “canned” taste)
            </li>
            <li>
                Sesame oil
            </li>
            <li> 
                Cornstarch
            </li>
            <li>
                Soy sauce
            </li>
            <li>
                Sugar
            </li>
            <li>
                Xiaoxing wine, sake, dry sherry, or white wine
            </li>
            <li>
                Fresh ginger
            </li>
            <li>
                White pepper
            </li>
            <li>
                Salt
            </li>
            <li>
                Dumpling flour (or a 2:1 mix of wheat starch and tapioca flour or cornstarch)
            </li>
            <li>
                Boiling water
            </li>
            <li>
                Oil
            </li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Peel and devein the shrimp if you didn’t buy it that way. Chop it up. You want to chop it pretty well so that it will hold together inside your dumpling wrappers. The pieces should be about the size of small peas.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a small bowl, mix together the seasonings for the filling, stirring so that the sugar dissolves in the liquid and it is all well mixed. Add that to the shrimp in a bowl and stir to mix well. Add the minced bamboo shoots and stir again to incorporate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover and refrigerate the filling while you make the dough and form the wrappers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Boil water.
            </li>
            <li>
                Put the dumpling flour and salt in a mixing bowl and stir to mix.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add 1 cup of boiling water to the dumpling flour-and-salt mixture and stir to mix. The mixture will become lumpy and half dry/half wet looking. Don’t worry. Just keep mixing. Use your hands, but be careful because it will be hot from the boiling water.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the flour and water are more or less incorporated, add the oil and mix it in.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer the dough to an unfloured cutting board and knead it until it is smooth and uniform, which will just take a minute or two. It will feel like playdough. Form it into a ball.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut the ball of dough into 4 pieces and stick them in a plastic bag. Let them sit for a few minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove one of the 4 pieces of dough and roll it out (again, on the unfloured board) into a log about 8 inches long. Cut the log in half. Next, cut each half in half again. And one more time, cut each piece in half. You should have 8 small pieces.
            </li>
            <li>
                Take one of the small dough pieces and use your fingertips to flatten it into a disk about 1 ½ inches across and about ¼-inch thick.
            </li>
            <li>
                Take a sturdy, quart-sized resealable plastic bag and cut it down the sides so that you have two flaps. Oil the insides of the plastic very lightly (I like to spritz a bit of oil on it and then wipe with a paper towel to create a very light film.)
            </li>
            <li>
                If using a tortilla press, place the dough disk in between the two flaps of plastic and then press it with the tortilla press. Carefully remove the flattened round of dough and repeat with the remaining 7 pieces. (ultimately you will do this with all 32 pieces. I like to form and fill 8 dumplings at a time).
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are not using a tortilla press, you can still use the plastic bag trick only press down with your cleaver, plate, skillet or whatever you are using to flatten your wrappers. The wrapper should be very thin when you are done.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spoon filling into the center of each wrapper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Using your fingertips, pleat one side of the wrapper to create a crescent shape around the filling. Fold the other side up to meet the pleated side and seal by pressing together with your fingers. Make sure the wrapper is completely sealed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill a skillet or pot that is wide enough for the basket to sit in or on top of and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium or medium-low to keep the water at a simmer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Arrange the filled dumplings in a bamboo steamer that has been lined with a parchment paper or reusable liner, leaving about ½-inch of space between the dumplings. You will need to use several baskets, or cook the dumplings in several batches.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the dumplings are arranged in the basket, cover the basket and set it over the pot with the simmering water. Steam the dumplings for 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve immediately.
            </li>
        </ol>
