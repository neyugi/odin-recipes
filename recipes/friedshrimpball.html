    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb. (0.4 kg) shelled and deveined shrimp, defrost</li>
            <li>1 egg white, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt or fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon corn starch</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon oil or some pork fat</li>
            <li>3 dashes white pepper powder</li>
            <li>8 pieces spring roll wrapper (8-inch square)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a mini food processor, add the shrimp, egg white, salt/fish sauce, sugar, corn starch, sesame oil, oil and white pepper. Blend until the ingredients form the shrimp paste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fold the spring roll wrappers up. Cut the spring roll wrappers into tiny strips using a pair of scissors. Cut them into shorter strips. Lay them on a flat surface. Wet your hands and form the shrimp paste into balls (about 1 tablespoon) and roll the shrimp balls onto the bed of spring roll strips.
            </li>
            <li>
                The spring roll strips will stick to the shrimp ball. Trim off the spring roll strips using a pair of scissors. Make sure that the strips  coat the shrimp ball evenly. You can reuse the strips that had been trimmed off.
            </li>
            <li>
                Deep fry the shrimp balls in a deep fryer or wok until they turn golden brown, about 5 minutes. Dish out, drain on paper towels and serve hot with Thai sweet chili sauce or your favorite chili sauce.
