    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Using a pair of scissors, cut the rice paper into long rectangles of about ⅓-inch x 2.5-inch. I recommend cutting 2-3 sheets of rice paper at a time to make this step faster. Transfer the cut rice paper sheets to a large mixing bowl. Add the saté paste and mix until the rice paper is evenly coated with the saté. You can use spatulas to mix, or your hands with gloves.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat the oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the chopped green onions and sauté for about 2 minutes. Transfer the green onions to the mixing bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                To the same skillet, add the sliced mushrooms and sauté for about 5 minutes, or until mushrooms start to brown. Pour in the soy sauce and stir to coat. Cook for one more minute and remove from heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the sautéed mushrooms, shredded green mango, maple syrup, lime juice, and roasted peanuts to the rice paper bowl. Mix until the rice paper starts to soften. As soon as the rice paper is soft, stop mixing otherwise it will clump. Taste and adjust saltiness and sweetness to your liking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve immediately at room temperature! This salad is best served the same day and I don't recommend putting it in the refrigerator otherwise it will harden.
            </li>
        </ol>
